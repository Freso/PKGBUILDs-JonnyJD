PKGBUILDs for the AUR
=====================

These are `PKGBUILD`_\ s for the Arch User Repository (`AUR`_).

That repository hosts user supplied source package definitons for `Arch Linux`_.

Most of the source packages from my git repo are listed here:
`Packages by JonnyJD <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?SeB=m&K=JonnyJD>`_

You can can open pull-requests on GitHub and also open Tickets here,
but make sure you comment in the AUR directly for everything that
is important to other users of a package.
